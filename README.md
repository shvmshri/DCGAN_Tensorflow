## SUMMARY
 â€¢	DCGAN
### *Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks*
#### Introduction	
One way to build good natural images is by training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANS). ,and we can later even reuse parts of the generator and discriminator networks as feature extractors for supervised tasks .DCGANs is actually one of the class of GANs using CNNs architecture for both of its components i.e.  a generator and a discriminator.
#### Model Architecture	
In general, GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator. These two are separately a CNN architecture and are trained together.
